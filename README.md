# Decision-Tree-Admission-mini-project.
this was done as a practice of using decision trees. the provided dataset was operated on using both decision tree regressor, and classifier using different tree criterions (will explained by the markdown cells). given that this mini-project was implemented via visual studio code, i found some problems showing the graphical representation of the decision trees. However, when i uploaded the same file on colab it they were displayed perfectly.
